Hi, Iâ€™m Karthik, a Digital Design Engineer with extensive professional experience in RTL design, formal verification, and hardware development. I completed my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, focused on building secure [cryptographic hardware implementation in verilog](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/ACORN128b2025/tree/state_in_top).

My engineering journey began with hands-on experience in protocols like PCIe, I2C, UART, and AMBA, and evolved through developing IPs, writing synthesizable RTL, and performing lint, CDC, RDC, and power analysis. Whether I'm implementing CDC FIFOs or debugging formal runs, I approach each task with precision and a passion for clean, efficient design.

### Workshops & Speaking

- **Speaker & Workshop Instructor**, *["Sand to Silicon: Build Your Custom ASICs"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7322883938060828672-fHcn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACyJs6IBHF0R8VMjlhgjaOi-3OXpyN-R9vs)*, Purdue University [March, April 2025]  
  Led a live session to design a **stopwatch in Verilog** and guided participants in deploying their programs on the **Terasic DE10 Lite FPGA board**.

- **ECE Department Internship Instructor**, Purdue University [January - May 2025]  
  Under the guidance of **Dr. Lizhe Tan**, led an internship for a small group of high school students, teaching them the basics of **electronics**, **PCB design**, and **digital logic concepts**. They successfully designed a **traffic signal controller** and a **vending machine**, standing out for their strong grasp of the material.

- **PCB Design Workshop Instructor**, Design Studio at Purdue University [March 29th, October 25th, 2024]  
  Conducted a hands-on workshop covering **PCB fundamentals**, including a live session on drawing schematics and trace routing using **KiCad**. Participants then soldered components onto their own PCB boards.
