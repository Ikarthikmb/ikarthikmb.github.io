Hi there!

{{ site.title }} is my personal blog. I’m Karthik Banakar — a Digital Design Engineer with extensive professional experience in RTL design, formal verification, and hardware development. I completed my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, where I focused on building secure cryptographic hardware and low-power digital systems.

My engineering journey began with hands-on experience in protocols like PCIe, I2C, UART, and AMBA, and evolved through developing IPs, writing synthesizable RTL, and performing lint, CDC, RDC, and power analysis. Whether I'm implementing CDC FIFOs or debugging formal runs, I approach each task with precision and a passion for clean, efficient design.

Outside work, I get around on a skateboard — blending motion with focus, just like in engineering. I thrive in fast-paced environments, whether remote or on-site, and I’m always ready to go the extra mile to bring projects to completion ahead of schedule.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, projects, and blog. Let’s connect and build the future of silicon, one line of code at a time.
