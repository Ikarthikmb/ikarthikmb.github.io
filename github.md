### [Hardware for ACORN Encryption/Decryption cipher algorithm](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/ACORN128b2025/tree/state_in_top)

- An implementation of the ACORN authenticated encryption cipher in Verilog. A real-world cryptographic design showcasing hardware-level security principles.


### [16-bit Neuron Unit with ReLU Activation](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/rtl_designs/blob/main/9_neuron_unit/README.md)

- The fundamental building block of an artificial neural network, using a 16-bit ReLU activation function. A step toward hardware implementations of machine learning.


### [AI Powered Solar panel monitor Hardware design](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/ai_solar_panel_monitor)

- This RTL block implements an AI-powered solar panel monitor. It takes the voltage, current, and temperature readings from the solar panel as inputs, and calculates the power and efficiency of the solar panel. The results are then displayed on an external display.


### [RTL to GDS for a Modified 8-bit Dadda Multiplier using 3:2 Compressors with sky130 PDK and OpenLane](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/dvsd_wt8216m)

- A modified Dadda multiplier uses 3:2 compressors to further reduce the speed and improve the efficiency of the design. The multiplier design uses two 8-bit inputs(A and B) to produce a 16-bit output.


### [Design of Inter Integrated Circuit I2C in Verilog](https://github.com/Ikarthikmb/i2c_ctrl2202/blob/main/verilog/rtl/i2c_ctrl2202.v)
