Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I code, create, and sometimes accidentally break things. The blog covers hardware articles, how-to's, workshops experiences, and electronic designs. 

Here, you’ll find my portfolio, a byte of my journey, and hopefully a bit of inspiration for your next project.

Hope you enjoy what you’re reading here!
